## Features

- **Decentralized Platform**: Eliminate intermediaries and facilitate direct transactions between buyers and sellers.
- **Transparent Usage Rights**: Smart contracts govern usage rights and ensure fair compensation for developers.
- **Global Accessibility**: Access a diverse range of AI models tailored to specific needs from anywhere in the world.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: Frontend framework for building React applications.
- Andromeda.js: Blockchain framework for decentralized applications.
- ADO Builder: Tool for building decentralized autonomous organizations (ADOs).
- Function: signandbroadcast - Incorporating purchasing of multiple NFTs using a single transaction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-model-marketplace.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-model-marketplace
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

## Deployment

To deploy the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.
6. You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
7. API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.
8. The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
